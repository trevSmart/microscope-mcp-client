# General guidelines:

This project is a client for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

# Execution modes:

1. As a CLI (interactive mode, this is the default mode)
2. As a single command to execute a single tool of the MCP server
3. As a library for test scripts

## As a CLI command (interactive mode)

```bash
ibm-test-mcp-client --server "server_spec"
```

## As a single command to execute a specific tool of the MCP server

```bash
ibm-test-mcp-client --server "server_spec" --call-tool "toolName {"k":"v"}" --
```

## As a library for test scripts

```json
"devDependencies": {
	"ibm-test-mcp-client"
}
```

# Testing

## Testing using the default NPM test scripts
You can test the client with the default NPM test scripts:
```bash
npm run test # interactive CLI mode
```
```bash
npm run test:oneshot # single tool execution, shows the tool response and exits
```
By default, the client will use the "everything" remote MCP server via npx.

## Testing the client directly without using the NPM test scripts

```bash
npm run build
node build/index.js --server "server_spec"
```

When performing the tests, you can use the following "server_spec" arguments:

- `/Users/marcpla/Documents/Feina/Projectes/mcp/ibm-salesforce-mcp/index.js`
- `npx:@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything`
